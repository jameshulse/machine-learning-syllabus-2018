Also has a book available with the same name

#### Books

### Machine Learning

#### Potential Projects

- [ ] Implement Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
- [ ] Implement k-Nearest Neighbor (see my tutorial in Python)
- [ ] Implement Naive Bayes (see my tutorial in Python)

#### Books

- [Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fundamentals-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Analytics/dp/0262029448/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1519397869&sr=8-1)
